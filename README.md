## 1) Extracting tweets
Twint uses the classic Twitter search and can thus retrieve all the tweets from an account. It can even retrieve only those containing the keyword of choice, or those posted between such and such a date, or from such and such a place, or only the retweets. It is also possible to retrieve all tweets from all Twitter accounts that mention the keyword of your choice. It automatically saves the data scrapped into a csv file named tweetsfromvodafonin2. Using this we scrapped all tweets of keyword vodafonein. About 20k tweets were scrapped using the following code

## 2) Data Cleaning:-
1. Removed all the stop words
2. Removed all the punctuations
3. Used word2vec model to vectorise the words.

## 3) K-Means:-
1. Used K-means clustering to cluster the data.
2. Divided the whole data into 8 clusters
